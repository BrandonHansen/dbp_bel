Bring to a boil.  Turn fire down to low.  Cover and cook until rice is done.  Allow to cool to room temperature.  Toast Nori lightly by waving briefly over an open flame.  Place on a kitchen towel or a sushi mat.  Top with a thin layer of rice, leaving 1/2-inch at far end of Nori uncovered.  Along the proximal end of the square, line up your filling of choice.  Roll in jelly roll fashion, using the mat or towel as an aid.  Remember that 1/2-inch of the tail end of the Nori you left uncovered?  Dampen it with a wet finger and use it to seal your sushi roll. You should end up with a sausage-like black tube, the filling in the middle.</p><p class=""H1"">      Slice into 1-inch disks with a very sharp serrated knife. Rinse knife between each slice for cleanest cuts.  Arrange on platter with small cups of soy sauce and wasabi.  Wasabi is a green powder that often comes packaged in a tiny tin.  Mix the powder with a few drops of water to make a thick paste.  Put a spoonful of it next to the sushi so the diner may mix it with the soy sauce before dipping in the sushi.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=""H3""><strong>Here are some suggested fillings for sushi rolls:</strong></p><table width=""100%"" border=""1px"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""10""><tbody><tr><td><span class=""H2"">preparation</span><br><p class=""H1"">      California Roll:  Crab, avocado, sweet red roe.</p><p class=""H1"">      Minced scallops in lemon dressing (see recipe).</p><p class=""H1"">      Shrimp with blanched slivered pea pods.</p><p class=""H1"">      Hana Roll:  Filled with tempera'd shrimp and asparagus.</p><p class=""H1"">      Grilled beef with shiitake mushrooms, spinach and toasted sesame seed.</p><p class=""H1"">      Or create your own combination from ingredients such as fresh tina, yellowtail, red snapper or flounder, shellfish, smelt roe or caviar, mushrooms, avocado, blanched asparagus, string beans or carrot strips, cucumber strips, tofu, boiled or omelet eggs, pickled quail eggs, slivered daikon and bean sprouts.</p><p class=""H1"">      You can also smear a trace of prepared wasabi down the center of the roll before rolling it up.  Be careful, because wasabi is very hot, but in the opinion of many sushi fanatics, it contributes much towards the ""addictive"" quality of sushi.</p><p class=""H1"">      Sushi means vinegared rice, and does not necessarily have raw ingredients.  In my experience, finned fish is usually raw, while shell fish is cooked.  Sushi is served at room temperature.  Do not bother refrigerating leftovers, for this makes the rice hard and unpalatable.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=""H3""><strong>Lemon Dressing (Goes With Sushi):</strong></p><table width=""100%"" border=""1px"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""10""><tbody><tr><td><span class=""H2"">ingredients</span><br><p class=""H1"">1  large egg (room temperature)<br>1  Tbsp. rice vinegar<br>1/4  tsp. salt<br>1/2  tsp. grated lemon peel<br>1  c. vegetable oil<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><table width=""100%"" border=""1px"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""10""><tbody><tr><td><span class=""H2"">preparation</span><br><p class=""H1"">      Process egg in blender for 15 seconds.

Use it to bind minced items in sushi filling.  Keeps in refrigerator for about 1.5 weeks.  You may make green onion dressing by substituting minced green onion for lemon peel.  Serves 6.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"
