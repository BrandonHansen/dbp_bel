SUSHI<!><!><!>You can also smear a trace of prepared wasabi down the center of the roll before rolling it up.  Be careful, because wasabi is very hot, but in the opinion of many sushi fanatics, it contributes much towards the "addictive" quality of sushi.<!><!><!>none
SUSHI<!><!><!>Sushi means vinegared rice, and does not necessarily have raw ingredients.  In my experience, finned fish is usually raw, while shell fish is cooked.
