Too many fillets deep fried together will cause fish to stick together and temperature will drop below 350° resulting in soggy fish.

8585<!><!><!>QUICK AND EASY BASIC DRESSING<!><!><!>Everyone has  a "favorite" way to roast the Christmas turkey, but here is one that is hard to beat!  (Attention, new cooks! Don't forget to remove giblets and neck.  Save to use in giblet gravy.)  Wash the turkey thoroughly, including cavities and check for pinfeathers.  Pat dry.  Sprinkle generously inside and out with salt and pepper.* Place bird, breast side up, on a rack on roasting pan.  Add 1 cup of water to bottom of pan.  Rub the outside skin all over the 1 to 1 1/2 sticks of softened butter. Place an aluminum tent over the bird, making tent large enough to cover loosely.  Do not let foil touch heating unit.  During cooking, lift foil tent and baste several times with juice in bottom of pan.  (Basting every 30 minutes assures a moist bird, so don't neglect!)  Roast in preheated 325° oven until tender; the drumstick will move easily when the turkey is done.  Remove foil last 10 to 15 minutes to brown, if necessary.<!><!><!>none
