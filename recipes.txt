BONELESS BUFFALO WINGS
ingredients
1  cup all-purpose flour
2  teaspoons salt
1/2  teaspoon black pepper
1/4  teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4  teaspoon paprika
1  egg
1  cup milk
2  chicken breast fillets
  4-6 cups vegetable oil
1/4  cup hot sauce
1  tablespoon margarine
  celery sticks
  bleu cheese or ranch dressing (for dipping)
preparation
      Combine flour, salt, peppers and paprika in a medium bowl. In another small bowl, whisk together egg and milk.  Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces. Preheat 4-6 cups of vegetable oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees.  One or two at a time, dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, then into the breading blend; then repeat the process so that each piece of chicken is double-coated.  When all chicken pieces have been breaded, arrange them on a plate and chill for 15 minutes.  When the chicken is done resting, drop each piece into the hot oil and fry for 5-6 minutes or until each piece is browned.  As chicken fries, combine the hot sauce and margarine in a small bowl. Microwave sauce for 20-30 seconds or just until the margarine is melted, then stir to combine. You can also use a small saucepan for this step. Just combine the hot sauce and margarine in the saucepan over low heat and stir until margarine is melted and ingredients are blended. When chicken pieces are done frying, remove them to a plate lined with a couple paper towels.  Place the chicken pieces into a covered container such as a large jar with a lid. Pour the sauce over the chicken in the container, cover, and then shake gently until each piece of chicken is coated with sauce. Pour the chicken onto a plate and serve the dish with bleu cheese dressing and sliced celery on the side.

      Cream butter and sugar; add eggs and beat well.  Add lemon extract and blend.  Sift dry ingredients together and add to creamed mixture.  Add molasses, blending well.  (Mommy never used nuts or candied fruit in her cakes, but these can be added if desired, also raisins.)  Bake in 4 or 5 small round cake pans at 325° for about 1 1/2 hours or until a clean broom straw inserted into the middle of cake comes out clean.
      When cake layers are cooled, use the apple butter to spread between the layers as you stack them.  (Mommy usually had at least 5 to 7 layers.)  Use caramel or other icing on top and sides. (Mommy always used her homemade caramel icing on top and sort of let it run down the sides without spreading it much and her cakes would literally just melt in your mouth!)

"VINEGAR FOR SUSHI"
ingredients
1  c. vinegar (Heinz white vinegar in glass is best)
2/3  c. sugar
2 1/2  tsp. salt
  pinch of ajinomoto (optional)
preparation
	Combine  vinegar,  sugar and salt in saucepan, stirring until sugar  dissolves.  Bring to a boil.  (If you desire, add ajinomoto when  liquid  becomes clear.) You can make a larger "batch" at a time and keep it on hand, making it handy to make sushi,  inari, maze-gohan, California roll, etc., frequently. The "su"  is  also very  good to make "sunomono" or for other salads.

SUSHI
ingredients
1  c. water
3  Tbsp. white vinegar
2  Tbsp. sugar
3/4  c. short-grain rice
6  Nori seaweed squares
  soy sauce
  wasabi
  filling of choice (see following)
preparation
      Combine rice, water, sugar and vinegar in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Turn fire down to low.  Cover and cook until rice is done.  Allow to cool to room temperature.  Toast Nori lightly by waving briefly over an open flame.  Place on a kitchen towel or a sushi mat.  Top with a thin layer of rice, leaving 1/2-inch at far end of Nori uncovered.  Along the proximal end of the square, line up your filling of choice.  Roll in jelly roll fashion, using the mat or towel as an aid.  Remember that 1/2-inch of the tail end of the Nori you left uncovered?  Dampen it with a wet finger and use it to seal your sushi roll. You should end up with a sausage-like black tube, the filling in the middle.
      Slice into 1-inch disks with a very sharp serrated knife. Rinse knife between each slice for cleanest cuts.  Arrange on platter with small cups of soy sauce and wasabi.  Wasabi is a green powder that often comes packaged in a tiny tin.  Mix the powder with a few drops of water to make a thick paste.  Put a spoonful of it next to the sushi so the diner may mix it with the soy sauce before dipping in the sushi.
Here are some suggested fillings for sushi rolls:
preparation
      California Roll:  Crab, avocado, sweet red roe.
      Minced scallops in lemon dressing (see recipe).
      Shrimp with blanched slivered pea pods.
      Hana Roll:  Filled with tempera'd shrimp and asparagus.
      Grilled beef with shiitake mushrooms, spinach and toasted sesame seed.
      Or create your own combination from ingredients such as fresh tina, yellowtail, red snapper or flounder, shellfish, smelt roe or caviar, mushrooms, avocado, blanched asparagus, string beans or carrot strips, cucumber strips, tofu, boiled or omelet eggs, pickled quail eggs, slivered daikon and bean sprouts.
      You can also smear a trace of prepared wasabi down the center of the roll before rolling it up.  Be careful, because wasabi is very hot, but in the opinion of many sushi fanatics, it contributes much towards the "addictive" quality of sushi.
      Sushi means vinegared rice, and does not necessarily have raw ingredients.  In my experience, finned fish is usually raw, while shell fish is cooked.  Sushi is served at room temperature.  Do not bother refrigerating leftovers, for this makes the rice hard and unpalatable.
Lemon Dressing (Goes With Sushi):
ingredients
1  large egg (room temperature)
1  Tbsp. rice vinegar
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. grated lemon peel
1  c. vegetable oil
preparation
      Process egg in blender for 15 seconds.  Add vinegar, salt and lemon peel.  Process 5 seconds.
      With blender running, add the oil in a slow steady stream. Dressing will become thick and mayonnaise-like.  Use it to bind minced items in sushi filling.  Keeps in refrigerator for about 1.5 weeks.  You may make green onion dressing by substituting minced green onion for lemon peel.  Serves 6.

SUSHI
ingredients
2  c. cooked rice
3  Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
1/2  tsp. sugar
6  Tbsp. water
preparation
      Mix apple cider vinegar with sugar and water.  Add to rice, toss to mix and coat well.  Shape into bite size rectangles or triangles; dust with toasted sesame seed (good source of Vitamin A).  Mix in leftover bits of fresh/cooked vegetables, meats; mix into rice.  Healthy, filling.  Sushi is vinegared rice.  Sashimi is raw fish..sometimes used to top sushi.

3  tsp. baking powder
3/4  tsp. salt
5  Tbsp. (1/3 c.) solid shortening
3/4  c. whole milk (plus or minus)
preparation
      Wash and cut up hen in frying size pieces.  Salt and pepper each piece.  Place in 5 quart pan, cover with water, and cook until thickest piece (usually the breast) "flakes" or separates easily with fork, approximately 1 1/2 hours.  If using a pressure cooker (Presto cooker), add water up to 3/4 of chicken; cook for 45 minutes.
      Dumplings:  while chicken is cooking, mix dumplings (using 2 bowls, make a recipe in each bowl).  Mix together the dry ingredients in medium size bowl, cut in shortening by cutting criss-cross with 2 dull dinner knives, or using pastry cutter, to size of small peas.  Add milk, mix with spoon.  If dough is too dry, mix in small amount of milk   if too sticky, mix in small amount of flour, then knead with hands, mounding into a round. Place dough on floured wax paper or flouring cloth.  Place wax paper on top of dough and roll out to about 1/8 inch round or rectangle.  With pastry cutter or sharp knife, cut in lengthwise strips, about 1/2 inch wide, then cut across strips to make 2 inch long by 1/2 inch wide strips.  Repeat with additional recipe.  Set aside.
      Remove cooked chicken from pan, reserving broth.  Discard skin and bone.  Tear or cut chicken in spoon size pieces, set aside. Strain broth;  divide evenly between two 5 quart pans or stock pots.  Add water sparingly to dilute to make approximately 9 cups, being careful not to lose rich broth taste.  If broth is not rich enough, add chicken bouillon granules.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
      Mix 3 tablespoons cornstarch with enough water to make a medium mixture.  Make another mixture for the other pan.  Add chicken, bring to a boil and slowly pour in cornstarch.  Drop in dumplings, a few at a time, being careful not to stir.  Use fork to separate dumplings in pan to allow room for all the uncooked dumplings.  Cook at medium for about 5 minutes.  Remove from burner, cover with lid; allow to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

SARAH'S SEATTLE PASTA SAUCE
ingredients
1  Tbsp. olive oil
1  lb. ground beef
1  medium onion, chopped
2 large  cans diced tomatoes (1 lb. 12 oz.)

1 (6 oz.)  can tomato paste
1/2  tsp. ground pepper (freshly ground)
1 1/2  tsp. salt
2 1/2  tsp. oregano

1/4  tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1  bay leaf
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/8  tsp. cumin
1  tsp. sugar
1  Tbsp. olive oil
preparation
      In a heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and crumble the beef into it.  Brown the meat lightly. (Break it up and separate the pieces.) Add the onion as the meat cooks.  When the meat is brown and onions transparent, pour off the fat and transfer to a large saucepan (not an iron pot, they give tomatoes an unpleasant taste). With the saucepan over low heat, add the tomato products and bring to a simmer.  Add the rest of the ingredients except for the sugar and 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      Cook, uncovered, over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Add a small amount of hot water if the sauce gets too dry during cooking. Skim off any fat on the surface.
      Half an hour before sauce is done, stir in sugar and olive oil.  This will not make the sauce greasy, but will round off the flavor.

The dough may be a little crumbly because of the cheese, but as you knead for a while, it will blend in.  Place in a large oiled bowl, turning to oil top. Cover  with a dry towel and place in a warm place until doubled in size,  about  1  hour.  I put mine in my gas oven that is not on.
      Punch dough  down,  form  into  a ball, then pat into a loaf shape, roughly the length of the baking pan.  Pop any air bubbles by  piercing  them.  Fold  sides  under and pinch seam tightly to seal.  Tuck the ends under and place in a greased 8 1/2 x  4 1/2-inch  loaf pan.  Cover with a towel and allow to rise again until  almost doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bake at  325° for 1 hour or until dark brown and done.  Rotate pan after  25 minutes.  Let  sit 8 to 10 minutes, then remove from pan.  Cool on wire rack at least 1 hour before cutting.
      For Rolls:  Pinch  off  dough  and form into 1 1/2-inch balls. Place  snugly  in  a  greased  9  x 9-inch baking pan. Cover; let rise and bake as above.

Sprinkle generously inside and out with salt and pepper.* Place bird, breast side up, on a rack on roasting pan.  Add 1 cup of water to bottom of pan.  Rub the outside skin all over the 1 to 1 1/2 sticks of softened butter. Place an aluminum tent over the bird, making tent large enough to cover loosely.  Do not let foil touch heating unit.  During cooking, lift foil tent and baste several times with juice in bottom of pan.  (Basting every 30 minutes assures a moist bird, so don't neglect!)  Roast in preheated 325° oven until tender; the drumstick will move easily when the turkey is done.  Remove foil last 10 to 15 minutes to brown, if necessary.

3/4  c. margarine
1/2  c. sugar

DAVID'S QUICK AND EASY SOUP
ingredients
3  c. water
3  chicken bouillon cubes
3  unpeeled or peeled potatoes, chopped into bite size pieces
4  carrots
2  c. mushrooms
preparation
      Put water, bouillon cubes and potatoes in a pot; bring to a boil and lower heat.  While cooking, cut up carrots and add to the soup.  While soup is simmering, clean and cut mushrooms (add more if you love them, less if you don't); add to pot.  Bring it all to a boil and then cook on low heat, covered, for about 25 minutes.
      From the first time it comes to a boil, it takes about 25 minutes to cook.  So, if it takes you 10 or 15 minutes to have your child cut up carrots and mushrooms, then it will take only 10 or 15 minutes more.  Makes 3 to 4 servings.
      This is a recipe that my 5-year old son, David Kohlbrenner, made up completely on his own.  It turned out to be delicious!  I cut the potatoes into big pieces and he then cut them smaller.  He scrubbed and cut the carrots.  I cleaned the mushrooms and he cut them.  I helped him to carefully drop things into the pot.
      I believe that a very young child could do this with adult help.  There is so little preparation time that the child won't lose interest before finishing.

  salt
  pepper
  butter
  seasoned salt (if desired)

preparation
      From a roll of heavy-duty aluminum foil, tear off approximately 24 to 36-inches.  Leaving the foil in one piece, place half on a flat surface, with the other half away from the working area. Spray the foil on the flat surface with the cooking spray.  Wash potatoes, removing defects, but do not peel.  Slice in 1/8-inch slices, horizontally.  Place sliced potatoes on the sprayed section of aluminum foil, keeping potatoes away from the edge.  Season with salt, pepper, butter, seasoned salt and onions, if desired.  Mix potatoes to spread the seasonings.  Fold the other half section of foil over the potatoes so it meets on the sides; fold on all 3 open sides to close securely.  Place on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Try not to peek, as the steam builds up inside and aids the cooking process.  "Package" may be turned once during grilling. To test for doneness, pierce through foil with a long-tine fork. My favorite parts of the "package" are the potatoes that are "extra-done" and stick to the foil.

HOW TO CAN VEGETABLES
Jar Transfer:
preparation
      Transfer jars with jar lifter or long handled canning tongs to and from canner safely.  Place hot jars on rack or towel, allowing 2-inches of air space on all sides for jars to cool evenly.
Points on Packing:
preparation
      Raw Pack:  Pack cold raw vegetables (except corn, lima beans and peas) tightly into container and cover with boiling water.
      Hot Pack:  Preheat vegetables in water or steam.  Cover with cooking liquid or boiling water.  Cooking liquid is recommended for packing most vegetables because it may contain minerals and vitamins dissolved out of the food.  Boiling water is recommended when cooking liquid is dark, gritty or strong-flavored, and when there isn't enough cooking liquid.
How to Check Canning Jars:
preparation
      The first step in home canning should take place long before food and equipment are assembled and ready to go.
      Jars and other supplies should be checked prior to the canning session.  In that way, you can replace damaged supplies and purchase new ones to avoid costly delays or inconvenience.  Here are some tips to help you.
      Choosing Mason Jars:  Jars manufactured especially for home canning generically are called Mason jars and must be used when preserving.  They are designed with a specially threaded mouth for proper sealing with Mason lids so, can with standard Mason jars only.
      Preparing Glass Jars:  Check all jars, rings and lids carefully.  Discard any with nicks or cracks in top sealing edge and threads that may prevent airtight seals.  Rings should be free of dents or rust.  Select the size of closures, wide mouth or regular, that fits your jar.  Wash jars in hot, soapy water and rinse well.  Then place in boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep jars in hot water until ready to use.  Boil lids according to package directions.
      Closing Glass Jars:  Always wipe jar rim clean after food product is packed.  Place lid on jar with button side up.  Screw rings on firmly, but don't force.  Do not re-tighten rings after processing or cooling.
      A new lid that snaps down and clicks as the jars cools, providing visible proof of sealing, called Magic Button
 is made by Owens-Illinois.  Its red button pops up when the seal is broken. The Magic Mason jars that go with the special lids have metric and U.S. measurements molded on the side.
Processing in a Pressure Canner:
preparation
      Corn is best when eaten as soon after picking as possible. Cook covered in 1/2 to 1-inch boiling unsalted water for 3 to 6 minutes.  (Salt toughens, so add vegie-sal later.)  Serve with soy margarine and vegie-sal.

POKE SALLET
ingredients
  poke greens
preparation
      Pick greens while they are still young and tender if possible. Greens will be sweeter if they have been frosted on!  Pick what looks like twice as much as you think you need, because they shrink up.  Wash the greens at least 4 or 5 times to remove all dirt. Remove any hard stems.
      Cut leaves or break them up with your hands.  Place greens into a large pot, cover and cook over medium high heat.  I add about half a cup of water.  When they have cooked until they are soft, add a few tablespoons of bacon drippings.  Mama used a slab of salt pork or a ham bone to season greens.
      Let greens simmer until done.  Add water as needed, if liquid gets low.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  The juice is called "pot likker" and it is good to eat poured over bread.  Let the pot likker cook until it is rich.  You will have about a quart of greens and a pint of liquid from a grocery sack full of greens.  A lot of people like to pour vinegar from pickled peppers over their greens.  Most everybody has to have cornbread with them, too.
      We sometimes added turnips, peeled and cubed, to the greens. But, a lot of people like them cooked separately.  Collard greens have larger leaves and have a stronger taste.  You can use dandelion greens, watercress, mustard greens, etc.

Place 4 tortillas on lightly buttered or oiled rectangular pancake griddle; let them warm through (you can tell by just touching them lightly with your finger), then turn each one over.  Top the 4 tortillas with the filling mixture as follows:  First, half of the cheese, vegetable mixture, bacon, pimientos and sliced ripe olives (optional), then the remaining cheese.  Put another tortilla on top of each.  Cook until bottom starts to brown and cheese starts to melt.
      Mash each quesadilla down from time to time with a spatula to help the cheese adhere to both tortillas.  With 2 spatulas (one on top and one slipped under the bottom tortilla), grasp the "sandwich" and flip it over; cook until brown on second side. Remove from griddle; cut into quarters and arrange on shredded lettuce.
      Note:  If using an electric griddle, set temperature to 350°.

FRIED OKRA
(Yellow Straight or Crookneck or Zucchini)  
Fried Green Tomatoes:
preparation
      Follow the recipe for Fried Okra.  Use medium sized, firm green tomatoes.  Don't salt until almost done.  Salt pulls moisture out of vegetables and makes too much liquid in the pan when frying. Try frying some tomatoes that have started to "turn" in with the green ones.  Red ones change the flavor somewhat.  I've had several people try my fried green tomatoes that were skeptical.  They changed their minds right quick!
Fried Summer Squash:
preparation
      Cook squash like you would okra (see recipe).  Pick small squash if possible.  If larger, you may want to scrape out the seeds.  Mama sometimes added a cup of sliced onion to squash when she fried it.  Like okra, home fried squash doesn't come out in solid slices all coated nicely.  They kind of merge and blend.  So, be careful how you stir it that you don't break it up too much.
