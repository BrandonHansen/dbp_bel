VORT LIMPA FAVORITE CHRISTMAS BREAD
ingredients
1 1/2  c. stout or ale (can use Coke)
1  Tbsp. anise seed, finely crushed
2  Tbsp. shortening
1/2  c. dark corn syrup or light Brer Rabbit molasses
  grated rind of one orange
1/4  c. sugar
1/4  tsp. salt
4  c. sifted all-purpose flour
2  c. sifted medium rye flour
1 cake compressed yeast or 1  pkg. dry yeast (as directed when using dry yeast)
1/4  c. lukewarm water
preparation
      Mix stout or ale, anise seed and shortening in saucepan; heat to lukewarm.  Pour into large mixing bowl.  Add sugar, orange rind, syrup and salt.  Mix well.  Add 2 cups white flour and 1 cup rye flour.  Beat until smooth.  Dissolve yeast in warm water and add to first mixture.  Beat until thoroughly mixed; add remaining flour. Turn dough out on lightly floured board.  Knead until smooth and satiny (elastic to the touch) using only enough flour to keep from sticking to hands.  This must be done quickly, but thoroughly. Place in well-greased large bowl.  Turn dough over to grease both sides of dough.  Cover and let rise until double in bulk.  Putting bowl over warm (not too hot) water quickens rising.  Let rise about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until double in bulk.  Shape into two loaves about 12-inches long.  Place in greased pans.  Can be baked on large cookie sheet, greased; grease between loaves, place loaves close together.  Let rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour.  Bake in moderate oven preheated to 350° about 45 to 60 minutes.  Remove from oven at once and turn out on cloth covered board.  Brush lightly with hot water.  Cover and let cool.  This recipe came from Sweden.  Seems complicated, but very simple once you've made it.

preparation
      Combine flour, salt, peppers and paprika in a medium bowl. In another small bowl, whisk together egg and milk.  Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces. Preheat 4-6 cups of vegetable oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees.  One or two at a time, dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, then into the breading blend; then repeat the process so that each piece of chicken is double-coated.  When all chicken pieces have been breaded, arrange them on a plate and chill for 15 minutes.  When the chicken is done resting, drop each piece into the hot oil and fry for 5-6 minutes or until each piece is browned.  As chicken fries, combine the hot sauce and margarine in a small bowl. Microwave sauce for 20-30 seconds or just until the margarine is melted, then stir to combine. You can also use a small saucepan for this step. Just combine the hot sauce and margarine in the saucepan over low heat and stir until margarine is melted and ingredients are blended. When chicken pieces are done frying, remove them to a plate lined with a couple paper towels.  Place the chicken pieces into a covered container such as a large jar with a lid. Pour the sauce over the chicken in the container, cover, and then shake gently until each piece of chicken is coated with sauce.

ingredients
  unbleached white flour*
  salt and cayenne to taste
  nutritional yeast flakes*
preparation
      *Flour ration should be approximately 4 to 1 yeast flakes.

CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS
Chicken and Broth:
ingredients
1  whole chicken (3 to 4 lb.)
1  small carrot
1  stalk celery
3  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. pepper
3  c. flour
1/2  c. shortening
1/2  c. milk
1/2  stick butter
preparation
      Wash chicken and place in a large pot with enough water to cover well.  Add salt, pepper, carrot and celery.  Bring to a boil; lower heat and cook at a gentle boil for about 45 minutes to an hour.  Be sure to add more water if it gets low.
      When chicken is very tender, remove chicken, carrot and celery from broth; discard vegetables.  When chicken is cool, remove meat from the bones.  Add meat back to the broth.  If the chicken broth does not have a good amount of fat on top, add a half stick of butter.
Dumplings:
ingredients
3  c. flour
1  tsp. salt
1/2  c. shortening
1/2  c. milk or more
preparation
      Sift flour and salt into a bowl; cut in shortening.  Stir in enough milk to make a stiff dough.  Turn dough out onto a floured surface.  Knead dough, but don't overwork.  Roll dough thin and cut into strips about an inch or two wide and about three-inches long. Coat the dumplings well with flour and let them air dry for an hour or two.  You can make these as you put the chicken on to cook and let them dry until the chicken and broth are ready.
      Bring chicken and broth to a boil.  Drop dumplings into pot, a few at a time, keeping the broth at a gentle boil.  When all dumplings are in, lower heat, cover and simmer for a few minutes. Add more salt and pepper if needed.
      An easier way is to thin dough with more milk and spoon dumplings into boiling chicken and broth mixture as directed.  It is faster, but the dumplings will be softer and moister.  You can also add a can of cream of chicken soup to make the dumplings richer.  I don't think Granny would have minded us saving time!

CHICKEN HARVEST SOUP
ingredients
1 1/2  sticks butter

2  qts. Milk
10  to 12 chicken bouillon cubes or chicken base
1  c. sliced baby carrots
1  c. sliced celery
1/3  c. diced yellow onion
1  tbsp. white pepper
3  Tbsp. onion powder
1  Tbsp. paprika
1  tsp. red pepper
3  lbs. raw chicken tenders, diced
6  oz. wide egg noodles
preparation
      Melt butter in small saucepan.  Add flour and cook on low to create roux.  Add more flour to get the pasty consistency.  Cook just enough to remove the raw flour taste.  Heat milk and bouillon cubes in double boiler until a "skin" of tiny surface bubbles forms on top.  Stir occasionally.  Whip in the roux a little at a time until desired thickness.  If you run out of roux before achieving desired thickness, make more and add accordingly.  This is the time to get the soup texture right.  If you wait to thicken, the soup will be lumpy and the noodles broken.  Remove from heat after thickening.  Move to another burner and add vegetables, spices and chicken.  Stir well.  Add raw noodles last.  Cook on low for 10 minutes, then turn off stove.  Let soup sit for 30 minutes as chicken and noodles finish cooking.  Stir gently with a wide spatula to avoid breaking the noodles.  If the starch in the noodles renders the soup too thick, thin with milk or half-and-half.  Reheat and serve with hot yeast rolls.  Recipe can be halved.

      Livers:  Cut into 1-inch squares and soak in water for 5 minutes.  Drain well.
      Mushrooms:  Discard stems (if dry mushrooms are used, follow the Sukiyaki recipe).
      Green pepper:  Cut lengthwise into quarters, then crosswise into halves or thirds.
      Leeks:  Cut into 1-inch lengths.  Thread each skewer with any combinations as desired, 4 to 5 pieces chicken, chicken and leek, mushrooms with green pepper, liver with leek or 4 to 5 pieces liver.  You may add any other vegetable to alternate the combination.  Be sure to leave a little space between each piece for even cooking.
      Place skewers on grill 5 to 6-inches from hot coals.  Repeat the following motion:  Grill few seconds, then dip into Yakitori sauce; return to grill until chicken is tender.  (Do not overcook.) Arrange Yakitori attractively on large platter and serve immediately with Shichimi pepper.  (Lemon or any other favorite spices may be used.)
      For indoor cooking:  Broil skewers about 5-inches from heat, glazing with Yakitori sauce as directed.  If desired, brush sauce onto skewers instead of dipping.  Serve with hot cooked rice and Miso Soup, as Japanese style, or simply serve with tossed green salad and hot biscuits.

CHICKEN & DUMPLINGS
ingredients

3  tsp. baking powder
3/4  tsp. salt
5  Tbsp. (1/3 c.) solid shortening
3/4  c. whole milk (plus or minus)
preparation
      Wash and cut up hen in frying size pieces.  Salt and pepper each piece.  Place in 5 quart pan, cover with water, and cook until thickest piece (usually the breast) "flakes" or separates easily with fork, approximately 1 1/2 hours.  If using a pressure cooker (Presto cooker), add water up to 3/4 of chicken; cook for 45 minutes.
      Dumplings:  while chicken is cooking, mix dumplings (using 2 bowls, make a recipe in each bowl).  Mix together the dry ingredients in medium size bowl, cut in shortening by cutting criss-cross with 2 dull dinner knives, or using pastry cutter, to size of small peas.  Add milk, mix with spoon.  If dough is too dry, mix in small amount of milk   if too sticky, mix in small amount of flour, then knead with hands, mounding into a round. Place dough on floured wax paper or flouring cloth.  Place wax paper on top of dough and roll out to about 1/8 inch round or rectangle.  With pastry cutter or sharp knife, cut in lengthwise strips, about 1/2 inch wide, then cut across strips to make 2 inch long by 1/2 inch wide strips.  Repeat with additional recipe.  Set aside.
      Remove cooked chicken from pan, reserving broth.  Discard skin and bone.  Tear or cut chicken in spoon size pieces, set aside. Strain broth;  divide evenly between two 5 quart pans or stock pots.  Add water sparingly to dilute to make approximately 9 cups, being careful not to lose rich broth taste.  If broth is not rich enough, add chicken bouillon granules.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
      Mix 3 tablespoons cornstarch with enough water to make a medium mixture.  Make another mixture for the other pan.  Add chicken, bring to a boil and slowly pour in cornstarch.  Drop in dumplings, a few at a time, being careful not to stir.  Use fork to separate dumplings in pan to allow room for all the uncooked dumplings.  Cook at medium for about 5 minutes.  Remove from burner, cover with lid; allow to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

ingredients

      Add the rest of the ingredients, including the juice from the can of beets (this takes up the place of the cream that would make this non-kosher).

Place one slice of roast beef in the center of the tortilla and top with a large leaf of lettuce. Roll up and place face down in a 9 x 13 pan to keep from unrolling.  Repeat with the remainder of tortillas and beef. Cover with Saran Wrap and refrigerate.  These are actually better if you can make them a day ahead.  Slice in half if you want before serving.

CHRISTMAS CANDY WREATH
ingredients
1  wire coat hanger
5  yards (2-inches wide)
  material (an old piece of cotton sheet works well)
4  feet aluminum foil
1  spool fine wire
4  lb. individually wrapped assorted candies
1  ribbon bow
1  pair scissors
preparation
      Cut coat hanger in center of wire base and then bring ends together.  Shape into approximately 10-inch circle; wire ends together with fine wire.  Cover circle by winding the 2-inch material using the entire 5 yards to form the base.  Then, wrap the foil around the material.  The fine wire for putting candy on the wreath should be in about 4 foot lengths or whatever length is convenient to work with.  When the preferred length is used, make a loop on the end by bending the end back and then twisting.  Place next wire through loop; bend end over and twist, thereby fastening ends.
      Begin by fastening fine wire at base of hook.  Twist wire around candy wrapper as tight and close to candy as possible. Twist around candy wrapper twice.  Place pieces as close together as possible.  This will make the wreath fuller.  Foil should not show through.  Repeat this until complete.
      Place scissors on a narrow piece of ribbon and tie to wreath hanger on top.  These will be used for cutting candy off rather than to pull or tear.  Use large bow over hook and hang wreath in well observed position.

CHICKEN HARVEST SOUP
ingredients
1 1/2  sticks butter
3/4  c. flour
2  qts. Milk
10  to 12 chicken bouillon cubes or chicken base
1  c. sliced baby carrots
1  c. sliced celery
1/3  c. diced yellow onion
1  tbsp. white pepper
3  Tbsp. onion powder
1  Tbsp. paprika
1  tsp. red pepper
3  lbs. raw chicken tenders, diced
6  oz. wide egg noodles
preparation
      Melt butter in small saucepan.  Add flour and cook on low to create roux.  Add more flour to get the pasty consistency.  Cook just enough to remove the raw flour taste.  Heat milk and bouillon cubes in double boiler until a "skin" of tiny surface bubbles forms on top.  Stir occasionally.  Whip in the roux a little at a time until desired thickness.  If you run out of roux before achieving desired thickness, make more and add accordingly.  This is the time to get the soup texture right.  If you wait to thicken, the soup will be lumpy and the noodles broken.  Remove from heat after thickening.  Move to another burner and add vegetables, spices and chicken.  Stir well.  Add raw noodles last.  Cook on low for 10 minutes, then turn off stove.  Let soup sit for 30 minutes as chicken and noodles finish cooking.  Stir gently with a wide spatula to avoid breaking the noodles.  If the starch in the noodles renders the soup too thick, thin with milk or half-and-half.  Reheat and serve with hot yeast rolls.  Recipe can be halved.

STEVE'S DEEP FRIED FISH
(Quebec Style)  
ingredients
1  Tbsp. vinegar
1/2  c. milk
1  c. all-purpose flour
1  Tbsp. baking powder
1/2  c. water or more (keep thinner than thick)
1/2  tsp. salt
  fish fillets
preparation
      Combine ingredients, except fillets and mix well.  Keep fillets cut 1 1/2 to 3 1/2-inches thick and batter cold so fish won't soak up too much oil.  Use peanut oil at 350° to 375°; a candy thermometer works well to maintain temperature.  Too many fillets deep fried together will cause fish to stick together and temperature will drop below 350° resulting in soggy fish.  Keep fish in oil until golden brown and place on wire rack over paper towel lined plate for crispness.  Use leftover batter and dribble in hot oil to make delicious crunchies that everyone will love. When done, strain oil through cheesecloth so you can use it several times.  Place potato slice in hot oil to remove all flavors.  This recipe works great with walleye, Northern pike or crappie.

SARAH'S SEATTLE PASTA SAUCE
ingredients

2  cloves garlic, minced
1/8  tsp. cumin
1  tsp. sugar
1  Tbsp. olive oil
preparation
      In a heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and crumble the beef into it.  Brown the meat lightly. (Break it up and separate the pieces.) Add the onion as the meat cooks.  When the meat is brown and onions transparent, pour off the fat and transfer to a large saucepan (not an iron pot, they give tomatoes an unpleasant taste). With the saucepan over low heat, add the tomato products and bring to a simmer.  Add the rest of the ingredients except for the sugar and 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      Cook, uncovered, over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Add a small amount of hot water if the sauce gets too dry during cooking. Skim off any fat on the surface.
      Half an hour before sauce is done, stir in sugar and olive oil.  This will not make the sauce greasy, but will round off the flavor.

"VINEGAR FOR SUSHI"
ingredients
1  c. vinegar (Heinz white vinegar in glass is best)
2/3  c. sugar
2 1/2  tsp. salt
  pinch of ajinomoto (optional)
preparation
	Combine  vinegar,  sugar and salt in saucepan, stirring until sugar  dissolves.  Bring to a boil.  (If you desire, add ajinomoto when  liquid  becomes clear.) You can make a larger "batch" at a time and keep it on hand, making it handy to make sushi,  inari, maze-gohan, California roll, etc., frequently. The "su"  is  also very  good to make "sunomono" or for other salads.

SUSHI
ingredients
1  c. water
3  Tbsp. white vinegar
2  Tbsp. sugar
3/4  c. short-grain rice
6  Nori seaweed squares
  soy sauce
  wasabi
  filling of choice (see following)
preparation
      Combine rice, water, sugar and vinegar in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Turn fire down to low.  Cover and cook until rice is done.  Allow to cool to room temperature.  Toast Nori lightly by waving briefly over an open flame.  Place on a kitchen towel or a sushi mat.  Top with a thin layer of rice, leaving 1/2-inch at far end of Nori uncovered.  Along the proximal end of the square, line up your filling of choice.  Roll in jelly roll fashion, using the mat or towel as an aid.  Remember that 1/2-inch of the tail end of the Nori you left uncovered?  Dampen it with a wet finger and use it to seal your sushi roll. You should end up with a sausage-like black tube, the filling in the middle.
      Slice into 1-inch disks with a very sharp serrated knife. Rinse knife between each slice for cleanest cuts.  Arrange on platter with small cups of soy sauce and wasabi.  Wasabi is a green powder that often comes packaged in a tiny tin.  Mix the powder with a few drops of water to make a thick paste.  Put a spoonful of it next to the sushi so the diner may mix it with the soy sauce before dipping in the sushi.
Here are some suggested fillings for sushi rolls:
preparation
      California Roll:  Crab, avocado, sweet red roe.
      Minced scallops in lemon dressing (see recipe).
      Shrimp with blanched slivered pea pods.
      Hana Roll:  Filled with tempera'd shrimp and asparagus.
      Grilled beef with shiitake mushrooms, spinach and toasted sesame seed.
      Or create your own combination from ingredients such as fresh tina, yellowtail, red snapper or flounder, shellfish, smelt roe or caviar, mushrooms, avocado, blanched asparagus, string beans or carrot strips, cucumber strips, tofu, boiled or omelet eggs, pickled quail eggs, slivered daikon and bean sprouts.
      You can also smear a trace of prepared wasabi down the center of the roll before rolling it up.  Be careful, because wasabi is very hot, but in the opinion of many sushi fanatics, it contributes much towards the "addictive" quality of sushi.
      Sushi means vinegared rice, and does not necessarily have raw ingredients.  In my experience, finned fish is usually raw, while shell fish is cooked.  Sushi is served at room temperature.  Do not bother refrigerating leftovers, for this makes the rice hard and unpalatable.
Lemon Dressing (Goes With Sushi):
ingredients
1  large egg (room temperature)
1  Tbsp. rice vinegar
1/4  tsp. salt
1/2  tsp. grated lemon peel
1  c. vegetable oil
preparation
      Process egg in blender for 15 seconds.  Add vinegar, salt and lemon peel.  Process 5 seconds.
      With blender running, add the oil in a slow steady stream. Dressing will become thick and mayonnaise-like.  Use it to bind minced items in sushi filling.  Keeps in refrigerator for about 1.5 weeks.  You may make green onion dressing by substituting minced green onion for lemon peel.  Serves 6.

SUSHI
ingredients
2  c. cooked rice
3  Tbsp. apple cider vinegar
1/2  tsp. sugar
6  Tbsp. water
preparation
      Mix apple cider vinegar with sugar and water.  Add to rice, toss to mix and coat well.  Shape into bite size rectangles or triangles; dust with toasted sesame seed (good source of Vitamin A).  Mix in leftover bits of fresh/cooked vegetables, meats; mix into rice.  Healthy, filling.  Sushi is vinegared rice.  Sashimi is raw fish..sometimes used to top sushi.

JALAPENO AND CHEESE BREAD OR ROLLS
ingredients
2 1/3  c. flour plus 1/3 c. flour
1 2/3  c. grated Cheddar cheese
8  tsp. sugar
1/2  tsp. salt
1/4  c. minced jalapenos
2/3  c. water (105~ to 115~)
1  pkg. active dry yeast
2 2/3  tsp. vegetable oil
preparation
      In a  very large bowl, combine 2 1/3 cups of the flour, cheese, jalapeno  peppers, 7 teaspoons sugar and the salt; mix well.  In another bowl, combine the water, yeast and remaining 1 teaspoon  sugar.  Let  stand  about 8 minutes;  stir to dissolve all  yeast  granules.  Add  oil  to  the liquid mixture, stirring well.  Then  pour  half  of the liquid mixture in the flour mixture.  With  a wooden spoon, stir to moisten flour as much as possible,  then  add remaining liquid mixture and mix until  flour is  thoroughly  incorporated.
      Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and  elastic,  about  15  minutes,  adding only enough remaining flour to keep dough from sticking.  The dough may be a little crumbly because of the cheese, but as you knead for a while, it will blend in.  Place in a large oiled bowl, turning to oil top. Cover  with a dry towel and place in a warm place until doubled in size,  about  1  hour.  I put mine in my gas oven that is not on.
      Punch dough  down,  form  into  a ball, then pat into a loaf shape, roughly the length of the baking pan.  Pop any air bubbles by  piercing  them.  Fold  sides  under and pinch seam tightly to seal.  Tuck the ends under and place in a greased 8 1/2 x  4 1/2-inch  loaf pan.  Cover with a towel and allow to rise again until  almost doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bake at  325° for 1 hour or until dark brown and done.  Rotate pan after  25 minutes.  Let  sit 8 to 10 minutes, then remove from pan.  Cool on wire rack at least 1 hour before cutting.
      For Rolls:  Pinch  off  dough  and form into 1 1/2-inch balls. Place  snugly  in  a  greased  9  x 9-inch baking pan. Cover; let rise and bake as above.

You might want to check the fruit mixture. Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture in medium mixing bowl. Stir in thoroughly. Sift in the second 1/3 and stir in thoroughly. Sift in the last 1/3 and stir in thoroughly. Dough will be very moist.
      Making The Cobbler:  Prepare the 9 x 9-inch deep dish baking pan or a very deep 5 or 6-inch cake pan.  Lightly grease. Sprinkle in a light covering of flour, making sure the bottom and sides have flour on them.  Line the pan with thin layer of dough (bottom and sides). Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar in the bottom of the pan.  Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of cream on bottom of pan.  Put pan on  a cookie sheet (to keep oven clean).  Pour in boiling fruit mixture. Cover mixture with thin layer of dough. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of sugar over top layer of dough.  Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of cream over top layer of dough.  Pour 1/8 to 1/4 cup of water over top layer.  Make 4 to 6 breathing holes. Cook for 40 minutes (or until golden brown) at 350°.  Serve in desired quantities with cream or ice cream.  Makes 9 servings.
      This was entered in the State Fair of Texas. It is more of a guide.  I never do it exactly the same each time. The more I practice with it, the better it gets.
      The recipe is an adaptation of ideas from my wife (Helen Todd), my mother (Martha Todd), my mother-in-law (Ermine Heckman) and my Grandma Todd and was created by me.

GRILLED VEGETABLE SANDWICH
ingredients
6  Tbsp. mayonnaise
1/2  tsp. chopped fresh parsley
  pinch of dried oregano
  salt
1  red bell pepper
1  small zucchini
1  yellow summer squash
1/4  eggplant
1/4  c. olive oil
2  sourdough French rolls
1  Tbsp. fresh grated Parmesan cheese
6 to 8 separated onion ring  slices (2 whole slices)
3 to 4  slices tomato (1 medium tomato)
2  leaves red leaf lettuce
preparation
      Preheat the barbecue or stovetop grill.
      To prepare a spread, put 3 tablespoons of mayo into a small bowl and add parsley, oregano and pinch of salt.  Set this and remaining mayo aside until you're ready to make the sandwich.
       Prepare the bell pepper by cutting it into quarters and seeding it. Brush the entire surface with olive oil. Slice the zucchini, squash and eggplant into lengthwise slices no more than 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick. Brush these slices with oil as well. Cook the red pepper on a hot grill for 2 to 3 minutes. At that point, add the remaining vegetables to the grill and cook everything for 4 to 5 minutes or until all the vegetables are tender. Be sure to salt the vegetables and, of course, turn them halfway through cooking time. When veggies are tender and begin to char, remove them from the grill and prepare each sandwich by first cutting the rolls in half lengthwise through the middle. Spread the parsley-mayo over the face of the bottom halves. Arrange the veggies on roll by stacking the zucchini, yellow squash and then eggplant. Peel the skin off the red peppers, then stack on eggplant. Divide the Parmesan cheese and sprinkle it over the peppers. Arrange the onions on peppers, then tomato slices. Add lettuce leaves. Finish topping with the remaining mayo and top of roll.

EASY GRILLED YELLOW FIN TUNA STEAKS FOR 4
ingredients
2 one  lb. yellow fin tuna steaks
3/4  c. Stubbs pork marinade
1  Tbsp. molasses
1/4  c. soy sauce
1/4  tsp. ground pepper
preparation
      Turn grill on and bring temp to medium high (approx. 20 minutes). Meanwhile, mix Stubbs pork marinade, molasses, soy sauce and ground pepper in a bowl or large cup. Set aside. Wash tuna steak with tepid tap water and place in flat bottom dish with sides (will be holding marinade, too). Fresh tuna should not smell fishy. Add marinade. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes or so. Turn tuna with tongs and let set for another 15 minutes. When grill is ready, place marinated tuna steaks on grill to sear side one. Pour part of the marinade on tuna. Cook on this side approximately 2 or 3 minutes with grill covered. Turn tuna over using flat spatula by quickly shoving under tuna while pressing down on grilling surface. This will help keep tuna intact. Reduce heat to low, pour on the rest of marinade and close lid. Tuna will continue to sear on higher heat and cook while temp. goes down. Turn once more after 4 or 5 minutes. Check tuna often during this stage. Remove from grill and let set for 5 minutes or so. Slice in half and serve.
       Usually a piece of tuna 5 x 4 x 1 1/4 inch will cook to medium rare in 8 to 10 minutes total. It should look whitish/beige brown on outside and bright pink inside for medium rare. All grills are different so you may have to practice the cooking of tuna a few times to get it just the way you want it. Cooking time will vary according to size of tuna.

ingredients
  Russet potatoes
  salt
  pepper
  butter
  seasoned salt (if desired)
  sliced onion (if desired)
preparation
      From a roll of heavy-duty aluminum foil, tear off approximately 24 to 36-inches.  Leaving the foil in one piece, place half on a flat surface, with the other half away from the working area. Spray the foil on the flat surface with the cooking spray.  Wash potatoes, removing defects, but do not peel.  Slice in 1/8-inch slices, horizontally.  Place sliced potatoes on the sprayed section of aluminum foil, keeping potatoes away from the edge.  Season with salt, pepper, butter, seasoned salt and onions, if desired.  Mix potatoes to spread the seasonings.  Fold the other half section of foil over the potatoes so it meets on the sides; fold on all 3 open sides to close securely.  Place on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Try not to peek, as the steam builds up inside and aids the cooking process.  "Package" may be turned once during grilling. To test for doneness, pierce through foil with a long-tine fork. My favorite parts of the "package" are the potatoes that are "extra-done" and stick to the foil.

Save to use in giblet gravy.)  Wash the turkey thoroughly, including cavities and check for pinfeathers.  Pat dry.  Sprinkle generously inside and out with salt and pepper.* Place bird, breast side up, on a rack on roasting pan.  Add 1 cup of water to bottom of pan.  Rub the outside skin all over the 1 to 1 1/2 sticks of softened butter. Place an aluminum tent over the bird, making tent large enough to cover loosely.  Do not let foil touch heating unit.  During cooking, lift foil tent and baste several times with juice in bottom of pan.  (Basting every 30 minutes assures a moist bird, so don't neglect!)  Roast in preheated 325° oven until tender; the drumstick will move easily when the turkey is done.  Remove foil last 10 to 15 minutes to brown, if necessary.

3/4  c. margarine
1/2  c. sugar
1  c. chopped pecans or nuts of your choice

DAVID'S QUICK AND EASY SOUP
ingredients
3  c. water
3  chicken bouillon cubes
3  unpeeled or peeled potatoes, chopped into bite size pieces
4  carrots
2  c. mushrooms
preparation
      Put water, bouillon cubes and potatoes in a pot; bring to a boil and lower heat.  While cooking, cut up carrots and add to the soup.  While soup is simmering, clean and cut mushrooms (add more if you love them, less if you don't); add to pot.  Bring it all to a boil and then cook on low heat, covered, for about 25 minutes.
      From the first time it comes to a boil, it takes about 25 minutes to cook.  So, if it takes you 10 or 15 minutes to have your child cut up carrots and mushrooms, then it will take only 10 or 15 minutes more.  Makes 3 to 4 servings.
      This is a recipe that my 5-year old son, David Kohlbrenner, made up completely on his own.  It turned out to be delicious!  I cut the potatoes into big pieces and he then cut them smaller.  He scrubbed and cut the carrots.  I cleaned the mushrooms and he cut them.  I helped him to carefully drop things into the pot.
      I believe that a very young child could do this with adult help.  There is so little preparation time that the child won't lose interest before finishing.

      From a roll of heavy-duty aluminum foil, tear off approximately 24 to 36-inches.  Leaving the foil in one piece, place half on a flat surface, with the other half away from the working area. Spray the foil on the flat surface with the cooking spray.  Wash potatoes, removing defects, but do not peel.  Slice in 1/8-inch slices, horizontally.  Place sliced potatoes on the sprayed section of aluminum foil, keeping potatoes away from the edge.  Season with salt, pepper, butter, seasoned salt and onions, if desired.  Mix potatoes to spread the seasonings.  Fold the other half section of foil over the potatoes so it meets on the sides; fold on all 3 open sides to close securely.  Place on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Try not to peek, as the steam builds up inside and aids the cooking process.  "Package" may be turned once during grilling.

HOW TO CAN VEGETABLES
Jar Transfer:
preparation
      Transfer jars with jar lifter or long handled canning tongs to and from canner safely.  Place hot jars on rack or towel, allowing 2-inches of air space on all sides for jars to cool evenly.
Points on Packing:
preparation
      Raw Pack:  Pack cold raw vegetables (except corn, lima beans and peas) tightly into container and cover with boiling water.
      Hot Pack:  Preheat vegetables in water or steam.  Cover with cooking liquid or boiling water.  Cooking liquid is recommended for packing most vegetables because it may contain minerals and vitamins dissolved out of the food.  Boiling water is recommended when cooking liquid is dark, gritty or strong-flavored, and when there isn't enough cooking liquid.
How to Check Canning Jars:
preparation
      The first step in home canning should take place long before food and equipment are assembled and ready to go.
      Jars and other supplies should be checked prior to the canning session.  In that way, you can replace damaged supplies and purchase new ones to avoid costly delays or inconvenience.  Here are some tips to help you.
      Choosing Mason Jars:  Jars manufactured especially for home canning generically are called Mason jars and must be used when preserving.  They are designed with a specially threaded mouth for proper sealing with Mason lids so, can with standard Mason jars only.
      Preparing Glass Jars:  Check all jars, rings and lids carefully.  Discard any with nicks or cracks in top sealing edge and threads that may prevent airtight seals.  Rings should be free of dents or rust.  Select the size of closures, wide mouth or regular, that fits your jar.  Wash jars in hot, soapy water and rinse well.  Then place in boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep jars in hot water until ready to use.  Boil lids according to package directions.
      Closing Glass Jars:  Always wipe jar rim clean after food product is packed.  Place lid on jar with button side up.  Screw rings on firmly, but don't force.  Do not re-tighten rings after processing or cooling.
      A new lid that snaps down and clicks as the jars cools, providing visible proof of sealing, called Magic Button
 is made by Owens-Illinois.  Its red button pops up when the seal is broken. The Magic Mason jars that go with the special lids have metric and U.S. measurements molded on the side.
Processing in a Pressure Canner:
preparation
      Corn is best when eaten as soon after picking as possible. Cook covered in 1/2 to 1-inch boiling unsalted water for 3 to 6 minutes.  (Salt toughens, so add vegie-sal later.)  Serve with soy margarine and vegie-sal.

POKE SALLET
ingredients
  poke greens
preparation
      Pick greens while they are still young and tender if possible. Greens will be sweeter if they have been frosted on!  Pick what looks like twice as much as you think you need, because they shrink up.  Wash the greens at least 4 or 5 times to remove all dirt. Remove any hard stems.
      Cut leaves or break them up with your hands.  Place greens into a large pot, cover and cook over medium high heat.  I add about half a cup of water.  When they have cooked until they are soft, add a few tablespoons of bacon drippings.  Mama used a slab of salt pork or a ham bone to season greens.
      Let greens simmer until done.  Add water as needed, if liquid gets low.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  The juice is called "pot likker" and it is good to eat poured over bread.  Let the pot likker cook until it is rich.  You will have about a quart of greens and a pint of liquid from a grocery sack full of greens.  A lot of people like to pour vinegar from pickled peppers over their greens.  Most everybody has to have cornbread with them, too.
      We sometimes added turnips, peeled and cubed, to the greens. But, a lot of people like them cooked separately.  Collard greens have larger leaves and have a stronger taste.  You can use dandelion greens, watercress, mustard greens, etc.

FRIED OKRA
(Yellow Straight or Crookneck or Zucchini)  
Fried Green Tomatoes:
preparation
      Follow the recipe for Fried Okra.  Use medium sized, firm green tomatoes.  Don't salt until almost done.  Salt pulls moisture out of vegetables and makes too much liquid in the pan when frying. Try frying some tomatoes that have started to "turn" in with the green ones.  Red ones change the flavor somewhat.  I've had several people try my fried green tomatoes that were skeptical.  They changed their minds right quick!
Fried Summer Squash:
preparation
      Cook squash like you would okra (see recipe).  Pick small squash if possible.  If larger, you may want to scrape out the seeds.  Mama sometimes added a cup of sliced onion to squash when she fried it.  Like okra, home fried squash doesn't come out in solid slices all coated nicely.  They kind of merge and blend.  So, be careful how you stir it that you don't break it up too much.
