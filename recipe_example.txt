  Russet potatoes
  salt
  pepper
  butter
  seasoned salt (if desired)
  sliced onion (if desired)
preparation
      From a roll of heavy-duty aluminum foil, tear off approximately 24 to 36-inches.  Leaving the foil in one piece, place half on a flat surface, with the other half away from the working area. Spray the foil on the flat surface with the cooking spray.  Wash potatoes, removing defects, but do not peel.  Slice in 1/8-inch slices, horizontally.  Place sliced potatoes on the sprayed section of aluminum foil, keeping potatoes away from the edge.  Season with salt, pepper, butter, seasoned salt and onions, if desired.  Mix potatoes to spread the seasonings.  Fold the other half section of foil over the potatoes so it meets on the sides; fold on all 3 open sides to close securely.  Place on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Try not to peek, as the steam builds up inside and aids the cooking process.  "Package" may be turned once during grilling. To test for doneness, pierce through foil with a long-tine fork. My favorite parts of the "package" are the potatoes that are "extra-done" and stick to the foil.

HOW TO CAN VEGETABLES
Jar Transfer:
preparation
      Transfer jars with jar lifter or long handled canning tongs to and from canner safely.  Place hot jars on rack or towel, allowing 2-inches of air space on all sides for jars to cool evenly.
Points on Packing:
preparation
      Raw Pack:  Pack cold raw vegetables (except corn, lima beans and peas) tightly into container and cover with boiling water.
      Hot Pack:  Preheat vegetables in water or steam.  Cover with cooking liquid or boiling water.  Cooking liquid is recommended for packing most vegetables because it may contain minerals and vitamins dissolved out of the food.  Boiling water is recommended when cooking liquid is dark, gritty or strong-flavored, and when there isn't enough cooking liquid.
How to Check Canning Jars:
preparation
      The first step in home canning should take place long before food and equipment are assembled and ready to go.
      Jars and other supplies should be checked prior to the canning session.  In that way, you can replace damaged supplies and purchase new ones to avoid costly delays or inconvenience.  Here are some tips to help you.
      Choosing Mason Jars:  Jars manufactured especially for home canning generically are called Mason jars and must be used when preserving.  They are designed with a specially threaded mouth for proper sealing with Mason lids so, can with standard Mason jars only.
      Preparing Glass Jars:  Check all jars, rings and lids carefully.  Discard any with nicks or cracks in top sealing edge and threads that may prevent airtight seals.  Rings should be free of dents or rust.  Select the size of closures, wide mouth or regular, that fits your jar.  Wash jars in hot, soapy water and rinse well.  Then place in boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep jars in hot water until ready to use.  Boil lids according to package directions.
      Closing Glass Jars:  Always wipe jar rim clean after food product is packed.  Place lid on jar with button side up.  Screw rings on firmly, but don't force.  Do not re-tighten rings after processing or cooling.
      A new lid that snaps down and clicks as the jars cools, providing visible proof of sealing, called Magic Button
 is made by Owens-Illinois.  Its red button pops up when the seal is broken. The Magic Mason jars that go with the special lids have metric and U.S. measurements molded on the side.
Processing in a Pressure Canner:
preparation
      Corn is best when eaten as soon after picking as possible. Cook covered in 1/2 to 1-inch boiling unsalted water for 3 to 6 minutes.  (Salt toughens, so add vegie-sal later.)  Serve with soy margarine and vegie-sal.

POKE SALLET
ingredients
  poke greens
preparation
      Pick greens while they are still young and tender if possible. Greens will be sweeter if they have been frosted on!  Pick what looks like twice as much as you think you need, because they shrink up.  Wash the greens at least 4 or 5 times to remove all dirt. Remove any hard stems.
      Cut leaves or break them up with your hands.  Place greens into a large pot, cover and cook over medium high heat.  I add about half a cup of water.  When they have cooked until they are soft, add a few tablespoons of bacon drippings.  Mama used a slab of salt pork or a ham bone to season greens.
      Let greens simmer until done.  Add water as needed, if liquid gets low.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  The juice is called "pot likker" and it is good to eat poured over bread.  Let the pot likker cook until it is rich.  You will have about a quart of greens and a pint of liquid from a grocery sack full of greens.  A lot of people like to pour vinegar from pickled peppers over their greens.  Most everybody has to have cornbread with them, too.
      We sometimes added turnips, peeled and cubed, to the greens. But, a lot of people like them cooked separately.  Collard greens have larger leaves and have a stronger taste.  You can use dandelion greens, watercress, mustard greens, etc.

VEGETABLE QUESADILLA COMBINATION
ingredients
1 medium onion or 1  bunch green onions
1  bell pepper
3 to 4  Tbsp. butter
1 (6 oz.)  can sliced mushrooms or 4 to 6 fresh large mushrooms, sliced
1/4  tsp. salt or to taste
6  oz. Cheddar cheese, shredded
6  oz. Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
8  (8-inch) flour tortillas
8  slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 (2 oz.)  jar diced pimientos
preparation
      Sauté onion and bell pepper in butter until barely tender.  Add mushrooms and sauté until mushrooms just start to darken as they absorb the butter.  Mix in salt and set aside.  Combine Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese.  Place 4 tortillas on lightly buttered or oiled rectangular pancake griddle; let them warm through (you can tell by just touching them lightly with your finger), then turn each one over.  Top the 4 tortillas with the filling mixture as follows:  First, half of the cheese, vegetable mixture, bacon, pimientos and sliced ripe olives (optional), then the remaining cheese.  Put another tortilla on top of each.  Cook until bottom starts to brown and cheese starts to melt.
      Mash each quesadilla down from time to time with a spatula to help the cheese adhere to both tortillas.  With 2 spatulas (one on top and one slipped under the bottom tortilla), grasp the "sandwich" and flip it over; cook until brown on second side. Remove from griddle; cut into quarters and arrange on shredded lettuce.
      Note:  If using an electric griddle, set temperature to 350°.

FRIED OKRA
(Yellow Straight or Crookneck or Zucchini)  
Fried Green Tomatoes:
preparation
      Follow the recipe for Fried Okra.  Use medium sized, firm green tomatoes.  Don't salt until almost done.  Salt pulls moisture out of vegetables and makes too much liquid in the pan when frying. Try frying some tomatoes that have started to "turn" in with the green ones.  Red ones change the flavor somewhat.  I've had several people try my fried green tomatoes that were skeptical.  They changed their minds right quick!
Fried Summer Squash:
preparation
      Cook squash like you would okra (see recipe).  Pick small squash if possible.  If larger, you may want to scrape out the seeds.  Mama sometimes added a cup of sliced onion to squash when she fried it.  Like okra, home fried squash doesn't come out in solid slices all coated nicely.  They kind of merge and blend.  So, be careful how you stir it that you don't break it up too much.
